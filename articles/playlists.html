              <p class="lead">As you’ve made it to my site, I’m quite sure that you have heard some classical music.
                And you probably have a concept in your mind of what it is. In that sense you have already «begun».</p>
              <p>But you might feel that you are still a beginner.
                You might sense that classical music has great experiences to offer, but that you somehow don’t «get it»,
                that you need to learn something more to fully appreciate it.</p>
              <p>Classical music is certainly a field where there is plenty of knowledge around.
                Of music theory, music history, and of course of playing it well.
                Thankfully, you don’t need too much of all that to appreciate the music.</p>

              <h3>The most important things</h3>
              <p>The main things you need to have great experiences with classical music, is to find time for it, and to listen well.
                Listening well includes being curious, being able to focus and to be patient with the music.</p>
              <p>Some might think good music experiences should be effort-free,
                that the composer should be able to reach us immediately. This is rarely the case with any great experiences.</p>
              <p>Think about a great nature experience.
                If you want to see an extraordinary view, you generally have to put in some effort to get there,
                especially if that view is from a mountain.
                And you have to look up from your phone, maybe even leave it at home, to get the most out of the trip.</p>
              <p>Many of the pieces I love the most today, didn’t excite me much the first time I heard them.
                As I heard them again and again, however, they grew into something meaningful and moving.
                Sometimes I even get curious about the theory or seek out the history behind the music.
                But more often, the music itself is enough for me.</p>
              <p>One thing you will not learn from me, is to appreciate every piece of classical music you find.
                You will rather learn to discern what you are able to appreciate from what you sincerely don’t like.
                That will not be difficult, as you have a musikal taste already. You just have to expand it a bit.</p>

              <h3>A beginner’s playlist</h3>
              <p>In this playlist you’ll find some rather short pieces from well-known composers.
                They aren’t «greatest hits», so they may be unfamiliar to you.
                And that’s the point – you need new music to learn how to get into it.</p>
              <p>Spend the next few days listening to the pieces again and again, until you feel you know them.
                Then you will inevitably make up your mind about what you like better and better, and what you grow tired of.</p>
